				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p style="text-align: justify;">With the constant growth of technology and cyber forensics, it is very important for you as well as your clients to be well known about the methods used for keep up digital evidence. We all know that maintain the digital evidence is of utmost significance as it may be presented by the attorneys and clients in a court of law if needed. Thus, <a href="https://thecyberforensics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Stellar Cyber Analytics</b></a> aware you of the preservation of digital evidence through the following points because even a negligent mistake can prompt you to lose important proof and disturb the case as well. </p></div>

			</div> <!-- .et_pb_row --><div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_1">

				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_1  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p style="text-align: justify;">For instance, once a lawyer visited us with a phone of his client for analyzation. But unfortunately, it is not recovered due to the small mistake of a lawyer. The phone is in the off state for a long time. As soon as the lawyer switch on the phone to see the evidence leads to automatic updates or downloads which overwritten the previously existing data. In this case, the chances of recovery reduce to a great extent. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So at that point, let’s have a look at the below steps that you must follow before bringing your device to the forensic experts. One can perform these steps according to the situation as fast as possible and immediately visit the forensic investigation experts. Time is profoundly significant in preserving digital evidence.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Always ensure never turn ON the device at all if it is in OFF state. In the case of personal computer, do not change its present status. If it OFF then rests in OFF state and if it is ON, do not turn it off rather call the forensic experts immediately.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li>Do not connect anything to the device, in particular, USB sticks, SD cards, and other social media devices while the data may be easily lost.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li>Make sure that the device must be placed in a secure environment. Record every detail like where the device is, who approaches and when it is moved.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device"><strong>mobile devices</strong></a>, if it is not charged, do not charge it. If the cell is ON, power Off immediately for remote cleaning and avoid data from overwritten.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li>Do not copy anything to or from the device.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li>Save all the digital information which you might think is useful for your case.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li>Avoid open any file, picture, and application in the device, this leads to accidental loss or overwrite in data.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li>The most important part is the password or pin of the device. Always remember such things.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="9">
<li>Make sure to take pictures of evidence both from the front and back to demonstrate its condition.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="10">
<li style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, stay away from the unprofessional guys. They may delete or corrupt your important information which can not recover further. </li>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p style="text-align: justify;">Without a doubt, it is seen over the previous year that cybersecurity hacking and data breaches are at its peak. When the word hacker strikes the mind, we mostly imagine the image of a person wearing a ski mask sitting in front of the computer. Generally, people think that hackers are bad people yet there is something else you should know about. All hackers are not similar to the persons in the real world, some may be bad and some may be good depending upon the practices, skills, targets, and plan. If you want to acquire knowledge about the different hackers in the online world,  continue reading.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First talk about the good ones namely White hat hackers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>White Hat Hackers:</strong> Another name of white hat hackers is ethical hackers and considered as good guys in the dark web. The primary aim of white hat hackers is to provide services to business firms and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1472952991"><strong>government organizations</strong></a> to find out the loopholes in the cybersecurity by following a strict code of ethics and their exceptional too. On the whole, white hat hackers are educated professionals certified with a college degree in computer science and IT security. In a nutshell, we can say that white hat hackers are individuals who hack your system with good intentions to find out vulnerabilities and then take necessary steps to remove them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The politically inspired</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Hacktivists:</strong> You can meet hacktivists through a social activist who supports religious, political or social lineup. It is safe to say hacktivist is an online version of an activist. In brief, a hacktivist is a group of anonymous hackers who join together to share a common thought of bringing social changes in government organizations through hacking or humiliate them by damaging sites.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Nation/state support hackers or actors: </strong>These types of hackers are straightforwardly associated with the state or national government to sneak out confidential data from different governments for the purpose of gaining a top position on the web. They are given a name-blind eye of the government&#8217;s legal system because their sole aim is to benefit the country by hook or crook. 
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The non-professionals </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Script kiddies: </strong>The defamatory term is frequently utilized by amateur hackers who do not care about monetary profit. They know very little or no coding skills rather use some tools and available hacking codes written by other professional hackers. They do so to grab attention and praise from friends and relatives. DoS and DDoS are the two commonly cyber attacks resolved through script kiddies. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last but not least, criminally influenced</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Composed criminals:</strong> These types of hackers strongly characterized the web commitments enclosed by the equivalent firmly manifested logistics network. This control empowers an organized criminal to earn profit as much as he or she needs. 
</li>
<li><strong>Dishonest insider:</strong> The most affected cybercriminals in the online industry. They sit beside you to actively look out your working for the purpose of threatening your organization or company. In case they get motivated by bonuses, which influences their position thus engage in wrongdoings.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cyber Mercenaries:</strong> These hackers are often hired by another hacker for the stake in the abundance
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Recurrent offenders: </strong>These hackers are just similar to the composed criminals and are not without some skills, yet they do not have the black market system of the composed lawbreaker.  Thus, the recurrent offender can&#8217;t benefit as much from their wrongdoings.
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify;"> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; color: black;">Out of all hacking threats, I think dishonest insider is the main threat who completely vanish your business. Be aware of such threat. That doesn&#8217;t mean you should not take care of other threats. So keep your business safe by utilizing smart security services from </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';"><a href="https://thecyberforensics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; color: #1155cc;"><span style="-webkit-text-decoration-skip: none; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; white-space: pre-wrap;">Stellar Cyber Analytics</span></span></b></a></span><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: 'Georgia','serif'; color: black;"> experts.  </span></span></li>
